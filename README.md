Invoice App (2007) is an application developed by me in Microsoft Access 2003(upgrade to 2007) using SQL for data management and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) for business logic and user interface interactions.
The application serves as a simple invoicing system, allowing users to:
– View the history of sales and purchases
– Create new sales transactions
– Store and manage client information
– Store and manage articles information

It was designed to offer a lightweight and user-friendly solution for small businesses and individual users who needed basic invoicing and client management capabilities.
